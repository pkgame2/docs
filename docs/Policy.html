                    Game Data Collection
                    <p>Whenever you play our games, we collect data about all of your interactions with the game and with the other players
                        inside the game via server log files. This information may be associated with your player ID, IP address or device ID

                    Other Collection
                    <p>We may also acquire information from you through (1) your access and participation in message boards on the Service, (2)
                        your participation in surveys regarding the Service or (3) your participation in a sweepstakes or contest through the

                    <p>We may also acquire information from you through (1) your access and participation in message boards on the Service, (2)
                        your participation in surveys regarding the Service or (3) your participation in a sweepstakes or contest through the

                    <p>We may provide you the opportunity to participate in a sweepstakes or contest through our Service. If you participate,
                        we will request certain personal information from you. Participation in these sweepstakes and contests are voluntary and
                        you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes
                        contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).</p>
                    <p>We use this information to notify winners and award prizes, to monitor traffic or personalize the Service. We may use a
                        third party service provider to conduct these sweepstakes or contests; that company is prohibited from using your users’
                        personal information for any other purpose.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cookies
                    <p>A cookie is a small text file that we transfer to your computer and/or device, to identify a user's computer/device and
                        to "remember" things about your visit, such as your preferences or a user name and password. Information contained in a
                        cookie may be linked to your personal information, such as your user ID, for purposes such as improving the quality of
                        our Service, tailoring recommendations to your interests, and making the Service easier to use. You can disable cookies
                        at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Service.</p>
                    <p>We may feature advertisements served by third parties that deliver cookies to your computer/device so the content you
                        access and advertisements you see can be tracked. Since the third party advertising companies associate your
                        computer/device with a number, they will be able to recognize your computer/device each time they send you an
                        advertisement. These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service and third party sites and
                        applications in order to measure advertisement performance and to provide advertisements about goods and services of
                        interest to you. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for the data collection practices of these
                        third party advertisers, and we encourage you to check their privacy policies to learn more about their use of cookies
                        and other technology.</p>

                        device. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the
                        application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the
                        information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application.</p>

                    Third Party Services & Marketplaces
                    <p>Our services may contain third party tracking tools from our service providers, examples of which include Google
                        Analytics and Adjust. Such third parties may use cookies, APIs, and SDKs in our services to enable them to collect and
                        analyze user information on our behalf. The third parties may have access to information such as your device identifier,
                        MAC address, IMEI, locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), geo-location information, and IP address
                        for the purpose of providing their services under their respective privacy policies. Our privacy policy does not cover
                        the use of tracking tools from third parties. We do not have access or control over these third parties.</p>
                    <p>Pitaya provides games and the Service via third party marketplaces, such as Apple's App Store and Google's Android
                        Market. These marketplaces may collect information about you or receive information from us in the course of providing
                        or analyzing their services. Pitaya is not responsible for these marketplaces, and is not affiliated with or responsible
                        for the actions of these third parties. You should review these third parties' terms of service and privacy policies,
                        which are separate from Pitaya..</p>

                    Ad Networks
                    <p>We may feature advertising within our Service. The advertisers may collect and use information about you, such as your
                        Service session activity, device identifier, MAC address, IMEI, geo-location information and IP address. They may use
                        this information to provide advertisements of interest to you.</p>
                    <p>In addition, you may see our games advertised in other services. After clicking on one of these advertisements and
                        installing our game, you will become a user of our Service. In order to verify the installs, a device identifier may be
                        shared with the advertiser.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Use of your personal information
            <p>We use this information to assist with understanding trends in usage and for help with tracking and correcting errors.
                We also use (and may provide to third party analytics providers as described below) country-level geographic location
                information to enforce our Terms of Service, customize the user experience and make recommendations to you.</p>
            <p>We may also give you the opportunity to opt-in to location-based services, which utilize a device's GPS coordinates. You
                may opt-out of these location services via the settings on your device</p>

            Security
            <p>Pitaya takes reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or
                alteration by third parties.</p>
            <p>Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected on the Service in a secure operating environment
                that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its
                transmission or its storage on our systems. Further, while we attempt to ensure the integrity and security of our
                network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers" from illegally
                obtaining access to this information. We do not warrant or represent that your information will be protected against,
                loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
